## üß± Database Schema

**Database**: `Sadri_projects`
**Table**: `Retail_Sales`

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Sadri_projects;
GO

USE Sadri_projects;
GO

CREATE TABLE Retail_Sales (
  transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  sale_date DATE,
  sale_time TIME,
  customer_id INT,
  gender VARCHAR(10),
  age INT,
  category VARCHAR(35),
  quantity INT,
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  cogs FLOAT,
  total_sale FLOAT
);
```

## üßΩ Data Cleaning Steps

```sql
-- Total Records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Unique Customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Category Types
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Delete rows with missing/nulls
DELETE FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
      gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
      quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

## üß† Business Questions Answered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Retail_Sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND MONTH(sale_date) = 11
  AND YEAR(sale_date) = 2022
  AND quantity > 4;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total\_sale) for each category:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales FROM Retail_Sales GROUP BY category;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category:

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM Retail_Sales WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total\_sale is greater than 1000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Retail_Sales WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction\_id) made by each gender in each category:

```sql
SELECT gender, category, COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY gender, category;
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:

```sql
SELECT year, month, avg_sale FROM (
  SELECT
    YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
    MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
    AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
  FROM Retail_Sales
  GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
) AS ranked_months
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales:
